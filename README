Information Extraction of Seminars

Part 1: Entity Tagging
    1) separated header from main body of text
    2) Created RegEx query to match dates from header
    3) Created RegEx query to select location from header
    4) Changed RegEx for time to only output the first result (BAD METHOD, FIX!)
    5) Fixed regex, using re.sub now
    5) Implemented Stanford tagger to extract names and organisations
    6) Tagged times and locations (bad implementation - add white space recognition in regex) in header
    7) Tagged speaker in header (add white space recognition in regex)
    8) Fixed time regex re.sub
    9) Tagged email with time, location and speaker
    10) Used Stanford NER to find 2nd occurring name in header if name is not able to be extracted using "who:" RegEx

    NEXT
    split speaker extraction variable to search for first or second names as well
    time 1:00 pm will be used to find same values in different format (e.g. 1pm)
    see accuracy of time and location tags
        F measure
    regex to extract sentences
    Regex for job titles Dr.|Mr.|Ms|Mrs|Prof. (NN1 NN2) probably indicates that NN1 and NN2 are a person name.
     Similarly the POS tag pattern NN1 NN1 Verb probably indicates a name.

Part 2: Ontology Construction
    1) Extracted header contents if 'topic:' exists
    2) Extracted most frequent words in a single email
    3) Extracted most frequent words in email corpus


    NEXT
    collect words in all topics in the email corpus and then order them by frequency, most frequent likely to be terms for ontology











stanford tagger
        use for name entities (speakers)
        don't parse each sentence individually
        parse entire email in one go
