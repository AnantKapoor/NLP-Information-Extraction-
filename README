Information Extraction of Seminars

Part 1: Entity Tagging
    1) separated header from main body of text
    2) Created RegEx query to match dates from header
    3) Created RegEx query to select location from header
    4) Changed RegEx for time to only output the first result (BAD METHOD, FIX!)
    5) Implemented Stanford tagger to extract names and organisations

    NEXT
    add tags
    see accuracy of time and location tags
        F measure
    regex to extract sentences
    Regex for job titles Dr.|Mr.|Ms|Mrs|Prof. (NN1 NN2) probably indicates that NN1 and NN2 are a person name.
     Similarly the POS tag pattern NN1 NN1 Verb probably indicates a name.
