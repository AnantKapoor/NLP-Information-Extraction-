Information Extraction of Seminars

Part 1: Entity Tagging
    1) separated header from main body of text
    2) Created RegEx query to match dates from header
    3) Created RegEx query to select location from header
    4) Changed RegEx for time to only output the first result (BAD METHOD, FIX!)
    5) Fixed regex, using re.sub now
    5) Implemented Stanford tagger to extract names and organisations
    6) Tagged times and locations (bad implementation - add white space recognition in regex) in header
    7) Tagged speaker in header (add white space recognition in regex)
    8) Fixed time regex re.sub

    NEXT
    for headers that don't include 'who:' use stanford ner to tag 2nd occurring name
    validate info from header to tag main body
    use tagged times and locations from header
    see accuracy of time and location tags
        F measure
    regex to extract sentences
    Regex for job titles Dr.|Mr.|Ms|Mrs|Prof. (NN1 NN2) probably indicates that NN1 and NN2 are a person name.
     Similarly the POS tag pattern NN1 NN1 Verb probably indicates a name.

Part 2: Ontology Construction
    1) Extracted header contents if 'topic:' exists
    2) Extracted most frequent words in a single email
    3) Extracted most frequent words in email corpus


    NEXT
    collect words in all topics in the email corpus and then order them by frequency, most frequent likely to be terms for ontology











stanford tagger
        use for name entities (speakers)
        don't parse each sentence individually
        parse entire email in one go
